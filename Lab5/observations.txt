Lab 5 Observations
==========================

Step 1: The threadSync program executes the created threads in order. The statements "Thread <i> Entered Critical Section.." 
and "Thread <i> returned" are printed in order from 0 to 9. This program differs from the threadHello program because it 
implements synchronization with semaphores that force each thread to wait its turn to execute the go function. The threadHello 
program did not implement semaphores so the output of the program varied each time it was run.
